# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A web UI for spinning up isolated [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) instances from any local folder **or Git repo URL**, each exposing a browser-based VS Code (`code-server`). Pick a source → the app copies the folder (or clones the repo), injects code-server into its `devcontainer.json`, runs `devcontainer up`, and publishes the editor on a unique host port.

## Runtime & commands

This runs on **Bun only** (Node.js is not supported). The app is built on **Mochi**, an SSR Svelte 5 framework with islands-based selective hydration, installed from npm as `mochi-framework`.

```sh
bun run dev        # dev server (MODE=development, project-local DATA_DIR, no browser launch)
bun run start      # runs src/index.ts directly (no separate build step needed)
bun run build      # mochi-framework build → .mochi/ (+ scripts/portable-manifest.ts, see npm packaging)
bun run typecheck  # svelte-check (with a custom warning-ignore flag) + tsc --noEmit; run after any TS/Svelte change
bun test           # all tests
bun test src/index.isolated.test.ts          # single file
bun test -t "renders Hello world"            # single test by name
bun run checks     # format + typecheck + tests — run this after every change (see below)
bun run clean      # remove .mochi build output
bun run lint       # prettier --check + eslint (read-only; `checks` runs format instead)
bun run gen:chimes # re-render attention chimes to public/sounds/ WAVs (after editing scripts/gen-chimes.ts)
bun run prod       # build + serve the production bundle (default PORT=6969)
```

**Always run `bun run checks` after implementing a change** (it runs `format`, then `typecheck`, then `test`) and fix anything it surfaces before considering the work done.

Tests that touch server state are named `*.isolated.test.ts`; pure unit tests (e.g. `src/avatars/*.test.ts`) use plain `*.test.ts`. `bunfig.toml` sets `root = "src"` (so vendored framework tests never run) and preloads `test-setup.ts`, which wipes `./.test-data` and forces `DATA_DIR` there before any module loads — a bare `bun test` can never open the real `~/.codebay` DB. Note that `db.server.ts` pins its SQLite handle to `globalThis`, so all tests in a run share one DB connection: a per-file `DATA_DIR` override only wins if that file opens the DB first, and don't `rmSync(DATA_DIR)` in a test's `afterAll` or you'll yank state out from under other tests.

Both `dev` and `start` execute `src/index.ts` with Bun (Mochi serves SSR pages on the fly); `build` is only needed for a precompiled production bundle. The `dev` script already sets `MODE=development`, `DISABLE_OPEN_BROWSER=1`, and `DATA_DIR=./.codebay` (keeps state inside the repo while developing).

**Port:** the server reads `PORT` (default 6969). When _you_ (Claude Code) run the app, use `PORT=4444 DISABLE_OPEN_BROWSER=1 bun run dev` so your instance stays separate from one the user may have running on 6969.

**Browser launch:** on startup the server opens the web UI in the user's default browser. Set `DISABLE_OPEN_BROWSER=1` to skip it — _you_ (Claude Code) should always run with this set (the `dev` script already does).

**Dev-only routes:** when `MODE=development`, `/debug` (UI component showcase) and `/debug/avatars` (every avatar sprite) are mounted.

## Architecture

**Request flow.** `src/index.ts` boots `Mochi.serve` (with the global `basicAuth` handle wrapping every request — see Auth below) and the route table in `src/routes.ts`. Routes are `Mochi.page` (SSR Svelte page), `Mochi.api` (JSON handler), or `Mochi.ws` (WebSocket). Pages SSR with minimal `serverProps` (plus a `snapshot` of the current instance list to avoid a loading flash); live data is then hydrated client-side over WebSockets. The dashboard (`/`) and tabbed IDE (`/ide/:id`) both render the same persistent hydrated `App.svelte` shell so navigating between them is an in-place client transition that keeps the code-server iframes mounted.

**Server-only modules.** Files ending in `.server.ts` (everything in `src/lib/`) are stripped from the client bundle by Mochi's tree-shaker. Keep Node/Bun APIs, Docker calls, SQLite, and filesystem access in `.server.ts` files — importing them into a hydrated component would leak them (or fail) on the client.

**Instance lifecycle** (`src/lib/instances.server.ts`) — the core orchestration:

1. `createInstance` validates the source (a **local folder** — copied — or a **Git repo URL** — cloned; `repo-url.ts` parses/normalizes the URL, `git.server.ts` does the clone and reads the live branch), allocates a host port, writes a `creating` row, and kicks off `boot()` in the background (the HTTP request returns immediately).
2. `boot()` (background): `copyWorkspace`/`cloneRepo` (copy skips `node_modules` but **keeps `.git`** so each instance retains its history/remote) → `writeOverrideConfig` (injects the code-server feature, a staged local `codebay-tmux` feature (best-effort build-time tmux install for firewalled containers; the post-up `tmux` injection is the runtime fallback), appPort + a `postStartCommand` launcher into the copied `devcontainer.json`, seeding the project's declared `forwardPorts`/`appPort` as port forwards, and returns the resolved `image_source`) → `devcontainerUp` (streams CLI output to the log buffer, parses the final JSON result line for the container ID) → post-up injection: runs every **container injection** in order (see Container injections below).
3. Status transitions: `creating → running` / `error`; later reconciled against live Docker state.

**Live streams over WebSocket** (`instances.server.ts`, `bridge.server.ts`, `health.server.ts`):

- _Central stream_ (`/api/stream`, `Mochi.ws`): one socket carries typed events for the whole UI — the full reconciled instance list **and** per-container health snapshots. A global `hub` broadcasts the list to all subscribers; it ticks every few seconds to catch external Docker state changes and pushes immediately on any mutation via `triggerReconcile()`. `listInstances()` reconciles persisted status against `docker inspect` and folds in in-memory attention + health state. A fresh socket is seeded with current state.
- _Per-instance logs_ (`/api/instances/:id/logs`, `Mochi.ws`): an in-memory `registry` keeps a capped log buffer (2000 lines) per instance; subscribing replays the buffer then streams new chunks.

The hub, log registry, attention map, health monitors, and DB handle are all pinned to `globalThis` (`__codebayHub`, `__codebayRegistry`, `__codebayAttention`, `__codebayHealth`, `__codebayDb`) so dev-mode hot reload doesn't reopen connections, orphan timers, or lose state.

**Reverse proxy** (`src/lib/proxy.server.ts`, spread into the route table as `proxyRoutes`): each running instance's code-server is served **same-origin** under `/p/:id/` instead of via its raw host port. `/p/:id/*` forwards HTTP to the instance's loopback `host_port`, and a WebSocket relay (dispatched through an internal `/__codebay_proxy_ws` sentinel pattern) tunnels code-server's sockets. Use `proxyPathFor(id)` to build IDE URLs.

**Bridge / attention** (`src/lib/bridge.server.ts`): an in-memory, UI-only signal each container can raise — `done` (Claude finished) or `waiting` (Claude needs input) — to pulse its IDE tab. The injected Claude hooks `curl` `host.docker.internal:$PORT/api/bridge/attention` with the instance id, a per-instance `bridge_token`, and a state. The `/api/bridge/attention` route is **exempt from Basic Auth** and authenticates by token instead; `bridge_token` is a container-only secret and is stripped from instance rows before they reach the client.

**Container injections** (`src/container-injections/`): each post-up thing the manager installs into a container is a self-contained `Injection` module — currently `git-safe-directory.ts`, `tmux.ts`, `git-identity.ts`, `claude-code-credentials.ts`, `claude-code-custom.ts` (opt-in LiteLLM/Bedrock endpoint + model IDs read from the `options` store; skipped when disabled or unconfigured), `github-credentials.ts`, `attention-hooks.ts`, `claude-skip-permissions.ts`, `claude-aliases.ts` (in registry/apply order) — exporting `apply()` (install + log), an optional `auth.status()` (host-credential availability), and an optional `check()` (live presence probe). The `Injection` contract and the registry (`injections[]`) live in `src/lib/injections.server.ts` — the single source of truth: `instances.server.ts` runs every `apply()` at boot, `health.server.ts` runs every `check()`, and `routes.ts` builds the setup-UI auth chips from every `auth`. Add or remove an injection by adding its module to `src/container-injections/` (which holds only the injection modules + their test) and editing the registry list. All container command execution goes through the shared `execInContainer` helper (`src/lib/exec.server.ts`), which runs `bash -lc <script>` via dockerode's exec API. Scripts still read secrets with `$(cat)`; the helper smuggles the secret in via the exec environment (never argv) and `printf`s it into the script's stdin, then `unset`s it — so callers are unchanged and secrets never hit the process arg list.

_To add one:_ create `src/container-injections/<name>.ts` exporting an `Injection` (`id`, `label`, required `apply(target, log)`, optional `auth` for a host dependency, optional `check()` for the health list), then add it to the `injections[]` array in `src/lib/injections.server.ts`. Array order is apply order — keep `git-safe-directory` first since later git-touching steps depend on it. That single edit wires it into boot, health probing, and the setup-UI auth chips at once; no other file needs touching.

**Health** (`src/lib/health.server.ts`): when reconcile sees a container running it starts a per-container monitor that re-probes every few seconds (is code-server answering on its host port, plus each injection's `check()`) and keeps the latest snapshot in memory; the snapshot rides the central stream. The per-injection presence rows are driven by the injection registry, so they track whatever injections exist. Live-only, never persisted; stops when the container is gone.

**Auth** (`src/lib/auth.server.ts`): a global HTTP Basic Auth gate (`basicAuth` handle) protects the UI, the APIs, **and** every proxied code-server — including the `/p/:id/*` proxy's WS upgrades (browsers send them with the cached `Authorization` header) — with one password. Disabled when `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` is unset/empty (local dev). Password and `bridge_token` checks use `timingSafeEqualStr` (`src/lib/crypto.server.ts`) so comparisons don't leak length/prefix via timing. The `/api/bridge/` paths are skipped because containers can't carry the app password. **Caveat:** Mochi's `handle` middleware wraps only page/api routes and the fetch fallback, **not** `Mochi.ws` routes — so `/api/stream` and `/api/instances/:id/logs` bypass `basicAuth` and instead enforce `wsUpgradeAllowed()` (same-origin + Basic Auth) in their own `upgrade` callbacks. Every WS upgrade (proxy + `Mochi.ws`) also gets a cross-site-WebSocket-hijacking guard: the `Origin` must match the request `Host`, which holds even when no password is set. Bind defaults to loopback (`127.0.0.1`); set `HOST=0.0.0.0` to expose on the LAN (do so with a password).

**Persistence** (`src/lib/db.server.ts`): `bun:sqlite`, WAL mode. Tables: `instances` (one row per instance, incl. the resolved `image_source`), `port_forwards` (extra host↔container port mappings per instance — see Port forwards below), and `options` (a generic key/value store, e.g. the picker's last-browsed folder via `getOption`/`setOption`). State lives under `DATA_DIR` (`src/lib/config.server.ts`) — default `~/.codebay` (outside the repo), overridable via the `DATA_DIR` env var (relative values resolve against cwd; `dev` sets it to `./.codebay`). The DB is `<DATA_DIR>/app.sqlite`; per-instance workspace copies live under `<DATA_DIR>/instances/<id>/`. Schema changes are numbered SQL files in the repo-root `migrations/` dir (`0001_init.sql` … current `0004_instance_image.sql`), applied on `open()` via `migrate(database, getMigrations(MIGRATIONS_DIR))` from `@zihaolam/bun-sqlite-migrations` — add a new higher-numbered file to evolve the schema.

**Port forwards** (`src/lib/devcontainer.server.ts`, `port_forwards` table, `src/components/PortsBox.svelte`): a project's own declared `forwardPorts`/`appPort` (minus code-server's 8080) are captured at boot and, together with any the user adds later, published on unique loopback host ports. `writeOverrideConfig` renders `appPort` **deterministically** from `hostPort` + the current forwards (discarding whatever the file held), so removing a forward actually drops its mapping on the next rewrite.

**Folder picker** (`src/lib/picker.server.ts`): `browse(path)` lists subdirectories for the source-folder chooser, flags which contain a devcontainer config, and persists the last-viewed folder in `options` so the next visit resumes there.

**Docker & devcontainer CLI** (`docker.server.ts`, `docker-client.server.ts`, `devcontainer.server.ts`): Docker Engine operations go through **`dockerode`** (the Docker HTTP API), via the shared client in `docker-client.server.ts`. dockerode honors `DOCKER_HOST` but not `docker context`, so the client resolves the daemon once at startup — `DOCKER_HOST` if set, else a single `docker context inspect` shell-out to read the active context's socket (Desktop, Colima, OrbStack, remote), else the default `/var/run/docker.sock` — and pins the instance to `globalThis` (`__codebayDocker`). That `docker context inspect` is the only remaining `docker` CLI spawn and exists purely for connection discovery. **Container creation still uses the `@devcontainers/cli` binary** (`devcontainer up`, resolved from local `node_modules/.bin`) — dockerode can't replace it. Host ports are allocated from the 8001–8999 range; code-server always listens on 8080 inside the container.

> Bun caveat: dockerode's `exec` _stdin streaming_ is unusable on Bun (the hijack path needs an HTTP `upgrade` event Bun doesn't emit; the non-hijack path can't half-close the request body). `execInContainer` works around this by passing the secret in the exec's environment and `printf`-piping it into the script's stdin — see below.

**Handles / theme** (`src/lib/theme.server.ts`): `src/index.ts` composes middleware as `sequence(basicAuth, themeHandle)`. `themeHandle` rewrites the SSR'd `<html>` tag with `data-theme` from the theme cookie via `transformPage`, so the first paint has no flash-of-wrong-theme; it fires for every HTML response including 404s and proxy passthrough. Client-only UI prefs (e.g. the attention chime toggle) live in `src/settings.ts` on `localStorage` and no-op during SSR.

**Avatars** (`src/avatars/`): each instance gets a deterministic 8×8 sprite via `pickAvatar(id)` against the `avatars[]` registry in `index.ts`. `serialize.ts` powers the in-app avatar-editor easter egg — it turns a drawing into the exact module source a sprite ships as, plus a pre-filled GitHub issue URL. Those "Avatar contribution: …" issues are landed via the `avatar-contribution-pr` skill in `.claude/skills/`.

**Distribution.** Three ways this ships: `bunx codebay` (bin entry `bin/codebay.ts`, which `chdir`s to the package root before importing `src/index.ts` because the server resolves the shell, pages, `public/`, and the `.mochi` manifest relative to cwd — so a published release must include a built `.mochi/`; the `files` list in `package.json` governs what's published); a GHCR image (`Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml`) that drives the **host's** daemon Docker-out-of-Docker — needs `--network host`, hence `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`, and a `DATA_DIR` bind-mounted at an identical host↔container path; and running from source. Versioning/publishing is automated by release-please (`release-please-config.json`), so use conventional commit messages. README's Configuration section is the canonical env-var list (`PORT`, `DATA_DIR`, `DOCKER_HOST`, `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`, `MOCHI_KEY`, `CODEBAY_CLAUDE_CODE_TOKEN`, `CODEBAY_GITHUB_TOKEN`, `DISABLE_OPEN_BROWSER`).

`writeOverrideConfig` parses the existing `devcontainer.json` as JSONC (custom `stripJsonc` strips comments/trailing commas) and merges in the code-server feature non-destructively — it operates on the _copy_, so rewriting/normalizing the file is safe.

## npm packaging (`bunx codebay`)

The app is published to npm as **`codebay`** and is meant to run via `bunx codebay@latest`.
`bin/codebay.ts` is the entry point: it `process.chdir()`s to the package root (the server resolves
`./src/shell.html`, `./.mochi`, and `./public` relative to cwd) after absolutizing a relative
`DATA_DIR` against the caller's cwd. `devcontainerBin()` resolves `@devcontainers/cli` via
`import.meta.resolve`, so it works from any cwd.

The tarball **ships the production build** (`.mochi` is in `files`): in production Mochi serves
static assets (the chime WAVs) only from the prebuilt manifest, so without it `/sounds/*.wav` 404s.
Both `bun pm pack` and `npm pack` honor `files` over `.gitignore`, so the gitignored `.mochi` is
packed. The version pins live in **`resolutions`**, not `overrides` — bun treats the two the same,
but npm rejects an `overrides` entry that conflicts with a direct dependency (`EOVERRIDE`), which
would break `npm publish`.

**`scripts/portable-manifest.ts` is load-bearing** (chained into `bun run build`): Mochi writes
`components[*].ssrModule` in `.mochi/manifest.json` as an _absolute_ build-machine path, and
`fromManifest()` `import()`s it — so an unprocessed manifest crashes on any other machine (and
locally silently loads _this checkout's_ SSR modules, giving two `svelte` instances and
`lifecycle_outside_component` island errors). The script rewrites build-root paths to relative and
exits non-zero if any disk path is still absolute. Re-check it after bumping `mochi-framework`.

**`bun run verify:package` (`scripts/verify-package.ts`) is the gate for all of the above**: it
packs the tarball, installs it into a throwaway project, boots it there in **production** mode, and
asserts the page renders, `/sounds/done.wav` is served, no island SSR errors are logged, and no
manifest path escapes the package. Run it after touching packaging; the release workflow runs it
right before publishing. Test in production mode only — dev mode chdir's into `.mochi/dev` and masks
both the cwd and manifest issues.

Releases go through `.github/workflows/release.yml`: release-please opens the release PR (and syncs
`bun.lock` on its branch); merging it cuts the tag, and the `publish` job checks out **that tag**,
typechecks, tests, builds, verifies the tarball, and runs `npm publish --provenance` (npm, not bun —
only npm can attach provenance; it needs `id-token: write` and the `NPM_TOKEN` secret). A failed
publish can be retried without a new version via the workflow's `workflow_dispatch` `tag` input.
Release-please also needs "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" enabled in
Settings → Actions → General, or it fails at PR creation.

## Mochi framework

The framework is a normal npm dependency, `mochi-framework@^0.8.2` (published from `github.com/khromov/mochi`, the `packages/mochi` subdir). Bump it like any other dependency; there is no vendoring step.

Two MCP servers are configured (`.mcp.json`) for reference: `mochi` (framework docs) and `bun-docs`. Consult them when working with Mochi APIs (`Mochi.page/api/ws`, hydration directives like `mochi:hydrate`) or Bun-specific APIs.
