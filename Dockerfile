# Codebay as a Docker-out-of-Docker (DooD) container: the manager runs in this
# image but drives the *host's* Docker daemon over a mounted socket, so the
# devcontainers it spins up are siblings on the host. See docker-compose.yml and
# the "Run with Docker" section in README.md for the run recipe (host networking
# + a same-path DATA_DIR bind mount are both required).

FROM oven/bun:1.3.14-alpine AS builder

# Install layer: only the manifest, lockfile, and patches, so it caches
# independently of source changes. patches/ is required because package.json
# declares a patchedDependency applied during install.

# Runtime tools the manager invokes as subprocesses:
#   docker-cli   — @devcontainers/cli and `docker context inspect` both need it
#   nodejs       — node_modules/.bin/devcontainer has a `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang (Bun can't run it)
#   git          — workspace/.git handling + reads the host global gitconfig
#   github-cli   — `gh auth token` fallback when CODEBAY_GITHUB_TOKEN is unset
